### What did you learn today?
Last night I tested using GPT as an *experienced developer* to brainstorm ideas for a simple cli tool.
It worked pretty well, honestly just the process of creating the prompt and making sure I understood all the 
requirements I wanted was a helpful process. I also learned about [GitHub Gists](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/editing-and-sharing-content-with-gists/creating-gists), and [created one](https://gist.github.com/mcclellangg/aa42bfac53805b705d4ee3ecc4bd0bdf) to
share the code that was created, and the prompt session I used to make it. I reran it today and realized I made a silly mistake of using a relative path 
variable for a script that was expected to be called from any directory not just the one it was stored in, so I quickly changed that and made a note in the script.

Learned about [Chatbot Arena](https://lmarena.ai/)

### Reflection
The more I think about **tags**, the more I think they should be created programmatically ...
Same thing with links ...
