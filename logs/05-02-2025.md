### What did you learn today?
I used GPT today to create me a `backlog.md` that I am using to capture smaller programming ideas. I
realize more and more how good llms are at "telling you what you already know".

I used a combination of *Cluade* and *GPT* to help me find a quote I could only vaguely remember
the sentiments of, and suspected to be from 1984. (Links included up top). GPT couldn't quite
get there but it got me a lot closer to the sentiment when it shared this quote from Orwell:


> “The most terrible loneliness is not the kind that comes from being alone, but the kind that comes from being misunderstood. It is the loneliness of standing in a crowded room, surrounded by people who do not see you, who do not hear you, who do not know the true essence of who you are. And in that loneliness, you feel as though you are fading, disappearing into the background, until you are nothing more than a ghost, a shadow of your former self.”
> ― George Orwell, 1984 

Most importantly the first part, then I realized the quote I was thinking of was more specifically about being understood, than it was about being alone. Although
the two do go hand in hand. I took the answer from GPT, and got the quote I was actually looking for from Claude:

> "The best books, he perceived, are those that tell you what you know already."
> 
> — George Orwell, *1984*

I've always thought writing has been difficult, llms are incredibly helpful in this regard. A lot of times I 
have a feeling in my mind about what I want to say, or how it should sound. I could describe it, and know what it
looks like when I finally get there, but it is REALLY HARD. I've gotten better at it over the years, but it is
still difficult. Honestly I think writing is hard, even for good writers.

LLMS ARE SO GREAT AT HELPING WITH THIS. So many times I have struggled to say something exactly like I want so I 
give them my attempts, and then articulate what I do and don't like about it. It is not always 100% correct, and I don't
always take what it gives me verbatim, but more often than not it gets me MUCH closer to what I want to communicate. In this regard it is 
AN AWESOME TOOL.
