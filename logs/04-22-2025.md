## What questions are the driving force behind this project?
- How are other people using LLMs (or Gen AI) to enhance productivity or workflows?
- What is a good mental model to use/keep in mind when working with LLMs?
- What are LLMs good at or bad at?
- Could I point an AI tool at a (mostly) unstructured repo of notes (i.e. this project) and create a much more useful summary?
- What are some other ways I can leverage it to enhance personal research and note taking (similar to a PARA or Zettelkasten)

## Interesting Projects
- Simon Willison has a really cool utility for interacting with LLMs via CLI 
  - [llm](https://github.com/simonw/llm)

### What new use cases did you try?
Started using DALL-E (I had tried it a bit before, but not much) to create quick reference images for
drawing. Normally I might use pintrest, but today I just got tired of looking at all the ads so I thought
I would try something new. Feels very useful for this use case, I'll have to try it more often.
