### What did you learn today?
I have had a lot of success with these types of prompts over the past few days.

```prompt
You are a ________, and your job is to ______. Ask me some clarifying questions
so that we can work towards a solution together.
```

Anything where you are explicit about what you know, and then get it to ask you questions or consider other options.
Even if I don't use the results of what it provides me, sometimes it does point out things that I may have not thought of,
or leads me to something more elegant/simple than I originally conceived. 

Very similar to [the prompt session linked in this entry](logs\05-01-2025.md).
