## What did you learn today?
Worked with web searches for getting up to date information from online documentation.

Mental model suggestion when working with llms: 

> My current favorite mental model is to think of them as an over-confident pair programming assistant who’s lightning fast at looking things up, 
> can churn out relevant examples at a moment’s notice and can execute on tedious tasks without complaint.

### Insights
- Really feels like there are so many more ways to interact with llms, gen ai than about a year ago. Also seems that
these interactions are now easier and somehow better (purely from an anecdotal standpoint).
