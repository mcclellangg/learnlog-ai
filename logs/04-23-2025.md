## Insights
- Responses seem to be much better when you provide some example format of the desired output
- [Multiple experienced developers](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Apr/23/) indicate that using LLMs/AI is a HUGE productivity boost
because they indicate it is able to write something that already lives in their head, while this is promising what does it mean for less 
experienced developers? How could they utilize it to learn quicker/how much quicker can we learn?

## Experiments
### GH Copilot (GPT-4o) vs Open AI (GPT-4o)
When asking both the following prompt:

```
Create me a jupyter notebook that I will use to demonstrate fundamental concepts of python dictionaries. 
Keep in mind it should be concepts that are most helpful when solving problems for interviews.
```

GH Copilot provided a summary of what the results would be, then was hung 'Thinking' indefinitely and never provided the
actual results. Haven't used GH Copilot that much, so it could be I may need to mess around with it more. Open AI provided
me a response in <15 seconds. 

## Project Idea
- Add tags to a repo of docs
  - [Prompt Created Example](https://chatgpt.com/share/6808f9c9-14b4-8005-90b1-04f2b93a91c2)
