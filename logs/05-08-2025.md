### What did you learn today?
Low effort prompts yield low effort results.

I [was working with GPT to debug a git config issue (scroll to end of prompt session)](https://chatgpt.com/share/681d1386-4a68-8005-a2d4-776b11b71770) and this thought became clear.
Towards the end I just kept copying and pasting the new errors that appeared each time I attempted to change the config value. I suspect GPT was just coding around my issue. 
It kept adding complexity (that I suspect was unneeded) to my command. I also suspect it was forgetting the *context* of my problem. I bet if I recollect all my errors, and create a 
refined prompt, it might give me an actual solution (or better solution) to my problem. Maybe I'll try again tomorrow.
