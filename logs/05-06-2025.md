### What did you learn today?
This seems so obvious but even when providing the same prompt, you can re-enter it numerous times and never get the same result.
Caveat, I was curious about temporary chats (with GPT) because I wanted an answer to a prompt that would not factor in all my historical data
with GPT. I got an incredible answer the first time, and reran it 6-8 more times, and although the other results were still
similar none of the subsequent ones came close to how great the first one was for me. I wish I had saved them all so I could compare
but I was using GPT on mobile, and didn't expect the results with the temporary chats to be so wildly different.

Really makes you feel like you're casting spells when using llms.
