### What did you learn today?
I tried really leaning on GPT for two mini projects I was working on. In one I asked 
it to [create me a few test cases with pytest](https://gist.github.com/mcclellangg/f1520accdaeb6279091aa9cb17c0044a), and in another
I [relied on it almost exclusively to help me setup a minimal project with DuckDB and Docker](https://chatgpt.com/share/681922ed-77d0-8005-8415-268afc24e311).

When working with GPT I realize the following:
It IS GREAT for asking it to make some boilerplate and do something simple for you
  - In the pytest example I was able to quickly see how pytest was working, and then create
  some tests of my own a lot faster than if I had read the documentation
  - In the Docker example I quickly saw how to get a dockerfile that would fit the needs of my project

It is NOT GREAT (or maybe I need to prompt more specifically) when you get into more specific use cases
  - In the pytest example a few of the tests it gave me would not have adequately checked what I was asking for
  so I changed or deleted them
  - In the Docker example it continued to suggest to me a command that was not viable (at least not with my install of duckdb)
  
  ```grayson
  I'm starting to think these are not viable commands:
  --listen-host=0.0.0.0 --listen-port=4213
  I am positive that I am on the latest version of duckdb and I don't see them available
  ```

  ```gpt
  You're absolutely right to question that â€” and I appreciate you verifying it directly.
  You're using the latest DuckDB CLI, and despite its version, it's likely you're using the official static build, which does not support --listen-host or --listen-port. These flags only exist in DuckDB when built with optional HTTP/WS support, and are not exposed in all prebuilt CLI binaries.
  ```

  - I also pretty blindly followed it's suggestions for setting up some env variables for the container only to realize what was getting suggested was
  never actually fixing my problem, and adding unneeded complexity to my project. I probably could have figured this out quicker on my own.


### RECAP
- Use GPT for boilerplate, and getting exposure to syntax
- If you plan on using it for more complicated aspects of a project CREATE A SPEC (or try something like `cursor`?)
    - VERIFY EVERYTHING
- Be suspicious or very careful for more complicated/nuanced use-cases
