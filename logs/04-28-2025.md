### What did you learn today?
Worked with `o4-mini-high` to help perform some sql tasks for my youtube music project. 

**REMINDER** - if you are not confident in the output of the llm, absolutely go back and double check. Before
blindly asking for something, maybe even take a few minutes to look into it yourself to see if you can 
quickly figure it out on your own (sometimes I feel like this helps cement things a bit better for me.)

Also added a link to an interesting story that was posted on Simon Willison's blog about a research
team getting caught using AI bots to try and change peoples viewpoints on the r/changemyview subreddit.
