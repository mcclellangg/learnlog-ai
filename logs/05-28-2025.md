### What did you learn today?
- Establish workflow for editing blog posts for spelling and grammar, and then copying them to known template

This is a very efficient way to convert plain writings into html templates. I admit this would probably not be needed
if I had a proper setup for serving this content (backend with models), but for where I am at this is a boon.

### Use GPT to spell check blog and convert to html template

1. Check spelling and grammar
```grayson
You're my writing assistant. I’m drafting a blog post and need a grammar and spelling check.  
Please review the following content, and if you find issues, create a Markdown file with the corrected version.  
Include notes on what was changed and why.

{insert_draft_here}
```

2. Convert to html from template
```grayson
Here’s an HTML template I use for blog posts:  
{insert_html_template_here}

Please convert the corrected version of my post into a new HTML file using this structure.
