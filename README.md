# learnlog-ai

**learnlog-ai** is a daily learning log built to track my ongoing exploration of artificial intelligenceâ€”particularly generative AI and large language models (LLMs). It was inspired by the curiosity sparked during the **PyData Virginia** conference and the desire to dig deeper into the space.

This project helps me stay accountable, encourages active research, and challenges me to turn unstructured exploration into structured, shareable notes.

## ðŸ“Œ Goals
- Build a daily habit of learning and reflection
- Record experiments, tools, papers, and ideas related to AI
- Aggregate scattered knowledge into organized markdown notes
